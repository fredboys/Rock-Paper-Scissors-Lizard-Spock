# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard & Spock

The Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard & Spock page displays a game that demonstrates JavaScript working in a real life format. Users can play against the computer and compete 1v1 to see who comes out victorious. 

The site will be targeted towards people who love The Big Bang Theory (thats where the game concept came from) and want to play it for real but also anyone else who might enjoy a twist on the traditonal game. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard & Spock is a fully responsive JavaScript game that will allow users to pick from all the objects and try to beat the computer.
